    /* This wait call is added to protect you from bricking the IC.
     *
     * When the IC resets, the bootloader will prepare the IC for use. During this time, SWD access is not possible.
     * When the bootloader is finished, it will open up SWD access and transfer control to the main application.
     * If the code of your application turns off SWD access almost immediately, the time window during which a debugger
     * can halt the core may become too small. The chance of timing the debug commands correctly becomes too small to
     * have a viable chance of success. As a result, the developer is locked out of the IC, rendering it useless.
     *
     * SWD access is turned off by reconfiguring one of the SWD pins (PIO 10 and PIO 11), or by going to the
     * Deep Power Down state or Power-off state.
     *
     * Another way to prevent your IC from becoming useless is to check a pin state at startup and to wait while it is
     * in an unexpected state - see for example the ResetISR function in app_demo_dp_tlogger.
     *
     * IF YOU ARE STARTING TO CHECK OUT THE DIFFERENT FEATURES OF THIS IC, START AFTER THIS WAIT CALL.
